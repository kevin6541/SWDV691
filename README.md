Software Development Capstone
This will be in addition to a web page I've been building for a local pharmacy. The intent of this project is to add online shopping capabilities to that site. Mostly the project consists of creating and interacting with a databse that will be both the backbone of the user interface presentation as well as the collection and storage of customer's, products and carts/orders. Ultimately the MVP goal is to have an intuitive interface that can be used to create a cart with login information to match customers with their orders. I will also be incorporating paypal add-to-cart buttons for security, an employee interface for updating products and searching for orders, and I would like to incorporate a password recovery feature as well. The current site isn't live/google-searchable yet but it can be found at tallmansRX.com running on an AWS server.  

The AWS folder contains the live/deployed files. The GUI folder contains the files that run on my local machine. The zip file of the database and api files are used to run the local GUI. Local GUI runs on MySQL. Live/deployed runs on DynamoDB.

The capstone video shows the database, api's, and interface running on my local machine. Proof of concept if you will.

Live/deployed is still a work in progress.
