Software Development Capstone
This will be in addition to a web page I've been building for a local pharmacy. The intent of this project is to add online shopping capabilities to that site. Mostly the project consists of creating and interacting with a databse that will be both the backbone of the user interface presentation as well as the collection and storage of customer's, products and carts/orders. Ultimately the MVP goal is to have an intuitive interface that can be used to create a cart with login information to match customers with their orders. I will also be incorporating paypal add-to-cart buttons for security, an employee interface for updating products and searching for orders, and I would like to incorporate a password recovery feature as well. The current site isn't live/google-searchable yet but it can be found at tallmansRX.com running on an AWS server.
